 -> Potato Late Blight

 -> Potato Healthy

Steps Taken:

 ->Extracted only the folders related to pepper and potato from the dataset.

 ->Organized the data into the respective classes as listed above for the classification task.

Planned Use: The processed dataset will be used for developing and testing a deep learning model for image classification. This project is intended to be shared on GitHub as an open-source initiative to help others learn or build upon this work.
